* Including full support of mouse, keyboard, gamepads and touch(mobile) inputs. Including pressing and holding.
* Change the size and fps of the canvas even while the game is running.
* Draw and check collisions for basic shapes and borders.
* Show text with fonts you choose and with many features like rotation and automatic line breaks at a chosen width,
* Edit and move the virtual camera to zoom or move the game, while still having elements like UI stay in place.
