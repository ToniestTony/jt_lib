# jt_lib
A library to make HTML5 games with the canvas much easier/faster! Made by Antoine Beaulieu Savard (ToniestTony)

Here are some of the features:

* **Load** and draw images and animations, even rotate and draw parts of them.
* **Play**, repeat and stop sounds (even in safari!).
* **Including** full support of mouse, keyboard, gamepads and touch(mobile) inputs. Including pressing and holding.
* **Change** the size and fps of the canvas even while the game is running.
* **Draw** and check collisions for basic shapes and borders.
* **Show** text with fonts you choose and with many features like rotation and automatic line breaks at a chosen width,
* **Edit** and move the virtual camera to zoom or move the game, while still having elements like UI stay in place.
* **Use** math functions that are frequently used in gamemaking like random, stay, angle, distance and many more.
* **Shake** the screen and use other misc features like alarms and checking for key combinations.
* **A bunch of other features!**
