# jt_lib
A library to make HTML5 2D games with the canvas much easier/faster! Made by Antoine Beaulieu Savard (ToniestTony)

Here are some of the features:

* **Load** and draw images and animations, even rotate and draw parts of them.
* **Play**, repeat and stop sounds (even in safari!).
* **Includes** full support of mouse, keyboard, gamepads and touch(mobile) inputs. Including pressing, holding and releasing.
* **Change** the size and fps of the canvas even while the game is running.
* **Draw** and check collisions for basic shapes and borders.
* **Show** text with fonts you choose and with many features like rotation and automatic line breaks at a chosen width,
* **Edit** and move the virtual camera to zoom or move the game, while still having elements like UI stay in place.
* **Use** math functions that are frequently used in gamemaking like random, stay, angle, distance and many more.
* **Juice up** your game with screen shakes, particles and other misc features like alarms and checking for key combinations.
* **Debug** with easy to use functions to quickly crush your bugs and get back to the important stuff.
* **A bunch of other features!**

## Getting started
* Download the jt_lib12.js file and index.html for a quick template.
* Start programming your awesome game in the setup and update functions of the template.
* **That's it!**

## More tutorials coming soon
I plan on making tutorials for creating simple games/prototypes to show how **simple** and **fast** this libray can be!

The jt_lib is free to use for both commercial and non-commercial projects, just be sure to put it in the credits!
